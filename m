Hmm, this memory-ordering issue is indeed pretty mind-bending. I'd like to
share a few thoughts as well. Happy to be corrected!

For our current problem, I think the key lies in the relative ordering between
the two variables, stride and obj_exts. To address it, we need to ensure that
on the writer side, stride is assigned before obj_exts. And on the reader
side, we need to guarantee that if it can observe the latest value of
obj_exts, then it must also be able to observe the latest value of stride. If
this understanding is correct, then even if the slab API caller inserts a
memory barrier between alloc and free, or uses a spinlock (or any statement
that provides an equivalent memory-barrier effect), it would only ensure that
the writes to the pair {stride, obj_exts} as a whole happen-before the reads
of {stride, obj_exts} as a whole. However, it still wouldn't be able to
guarantee the ordering between the two variables: stride and obj_exts.
